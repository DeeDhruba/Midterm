            <h1>Welcome to Sequoia National Park!</h1>
            <p>Explore the breathtaking trails and activities at Sequoia National Park. Enjoy hiking, skiing, and more in a stunning natural setting</p>
            <p>
                A historic snowpack and flooding over the winter of 2022-2023 significantly affected the parks and surrounding areas. Repair and recovery is ongoing. Be prepared for temporary road repairs, temporary closures of some facilities, and the possibility that some areas may not be able to open as usual in 2024. 
                Wherever and whenever you visit the parks, you'll experience one of the finest and wildest areas of the Sierra Nevada mountain range!
                No reservations are required to enter the parks. If you're coming soon, check our Current Conditions page for more information.</p>

                    <h2>Wapama Falls</h2>
                    <p>If you've never taken a shower with your clothes on, cross the bridges below the falls in the springtime,
                     and you'll never have to wonder about that particular experience again. If this doesn't appeal to you, 
                     take your clothes off first to keep them dry and add extra interest to the hike for everyone in your party.</p>
                     <p><strong>Best Time to Visit:  in the spring, when there's lots of water pouring over the falls. Though if you're too
                     early, there can be so much water that the trail is impassable</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Moro Rock Trail</h2>
                    <p>Challenge yourself with a climb up Moro Rock and enjoy panoramic views from the summit.</p>
                    <p>Moro Rock is a promigranite protrusion on the edge of the Giant Forest visible to everyone driving up the Generals Highway into Sequoia National Park
                        from the south <strong> Moro Rock rises 6,725 feet above sea level, but hikers only have to climb the last 300 feet of that elevation to enjoy the
                        vast panoramic views.</strong> Whether you're an adrenaline junkie or a nature
                        enthusiast, our guided tours provide a safe and exhilarating opportunity to observe the hike. The trail is half a mile round trip, crossing ledges
                         that will give wobbly legs to anyone with a fear of heights.</p>

                    <h2>Winter Sports</h2>
                    <p>Experience the winter wonderland with skiing and snowshoeing tours starting in mid-January.</p>
                    <p>Snowshoe walks are anticipated to begin mid-January and will end as snow conditions deteriorate.
                        If snow conditions are poor, rangers may offer a guided hike instead of a snowshoe walk. For these hikes, we recommend traction devices (cleats) for your boots.
                        No experience necessary! We provide the snowshoes; you are responsible for bringing warm layered clothing, waterproof boots, gloves, hat, sunglasses, sunscreen,
                        water, and food. The walks are moderately strenuous.,<strong> Children who participate in ranger-led snowshoe walks must be
                        10 years and up (due to the size of the snowshoes and moderately strenuous conditions). Waterproof shoes are required (no tennis shoes). Walks are about 1.5 hours
                        and range from 1 to 2 miles in length</strong>.</p>
